# Instructions

## Movie site

The goal for this week is to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies (more on which movies further down), display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

This time, rather than following designs from a set of images, we'd like you to follow (or even better: improve) the design which we've created in our example app using the same API.

In this app, we've used the API to fetch popular movies in the US. You are free to choose whatever endpoint you'd like to build up your list. You could do the same as us, or you could, for example, show movies which are currently in the cinema or find movies in a particular genre. It's up to you!

### Using the API

You will need to register an account with themoviedb.org and then register for an API key in order to use the API.

When signing up for an API key, it asks a bunch of questions about what the application is for, but don't worry - we've contacted themoviedb.org and checked that they're OK with you all using the API for this purpose and it's all good in the hood. So, this is what you need to do:

- Signup for themoviedb.org [This is an external link to genome.gov](https://www.genome.gov/)

### Requirements:

- Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

### Your page should be responsive:

- Adapting to the different viewports

### Design

How you design your page is up to you, but take accessibility into account when you are styling your form elements - so inputs should have labels and should be easily readable and usable. We STRONGLY recommend having some kind of design or sketch before starting to code.

Feel free to use other survey tools such as Typeform, Google Forms as inspiration. Or you can check out Dribbble, Behance or Pinterest.
